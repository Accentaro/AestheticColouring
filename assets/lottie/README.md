# Lottie Placeholder

Place production-ready Lottie JSON files here to power advanced neon shaders.

* `neon_pulse.json` â€“ TODO: Provide animated glow pulsations synced with audio.
* Keep files lightweight (<1MB) to preserve load times.
* Remember to declare assets in `build.gradle` if using the asset pipeline.
