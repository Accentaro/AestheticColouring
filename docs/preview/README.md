# Preview Assets Placeholder

Drop marketing screenshots, looping GIFs, or short MP4 previews for the Play Store into this folder.

* Use descriptive filenames such as `phone-home.png`, `tablet-playground.gif`, or `promo-loop.mp4`.
* Keep raw design files (Figma/PSD) out of the repo; store them in your asset pipeline.
* The CI workflow ignores this directory unless you add actual images/videos later.
* Update the Play Console listing to reference the final export dimensions once assets are ready.

_No binary assets are included in this scaffold._
