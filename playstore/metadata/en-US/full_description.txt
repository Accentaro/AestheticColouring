## Overview
Trippify is an immersive neon playground built for mindful sensory exploration. The production release must replace this placeholder copy with marketing-approved text that highlights:

- Audio-reactive ripple scenes and interactive trails
- Calming soundscapes with smooth crossfades
- Premium palette creation, advanced effects, and ad-free sessions

## Requirements
- Keep within Google Play Store character limits (80 for short description, 4000 for full description).
- Avoid unsupported formatting (Markdown headings should be stripped before publishing).
- Mention microphone permission usage for audio-reactive features and clarify that it is optional.
